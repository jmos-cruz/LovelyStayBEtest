# LovelyStayBEtest
Personal solution to the Lovely Stay backend (BE) test

The project comprises one main TypeScript file, main.ts, that contains the entry point of the program and the general user experience flow of the program. The corresponding JavaScript file, main.js, carries the compiled result of the main TS file.

To start the command-line program, use the command `node main.js`. 

You will then be prompted with 4 choices. 

The first choice will prompt you with a GitHub username to store in a PostgreSQL database (database queries are done using [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise)).

The second choice will print all users stored in the database (not yet implemented).

The third choice selects users based on location or programming languages used by a GitHub user, depending on your option.

The fourth choice quits the program.
