# LovelyStayBEtest
Personal solution to the Lovely Stay backend (BE) test

The project comprises two folders, one carrying the TypeScript files and the other carrying the compiled JavaScript files. In each folder there is a file, "main", which contains the entry point of the program and the guided user interface.

To start the command-line program, use the command `node main.js` inside the Javascript folder. 

You will then be prompted with 4 choices. 

The first choice will prompt you with a GitHub username to store in a PostgreSQL database (database queries are done using [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise)).

The second choice will print all users stored in the database.

The third choice selects users based on location or programming languages used by a GitHub user, depending on your option.

The fourth choice quits the program.
